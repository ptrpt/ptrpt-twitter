# Dependencies
#
# When releasing a production app, you may 
# consider including your node_modules and
# bower_components directory in your git repo,
# but during development, its best to exclude it,
# since different developers may be working on
# different kernels, where dependencies would
# need to be recompiled anyway.
#
# More on that here about node_modules dir:
